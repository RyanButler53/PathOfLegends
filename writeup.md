# Path of Legends Investigation:

## Abstract: 

In this investigation, I model the Path of Legends (PoL). Using this model, I can gain insights about the PoL and determine the effects of moving/removing golden steps on th percntage of players who reach Ultimate champion. I found that {SOLUTION PARAMS HERE} provides a 1% UC rate and maximizes winrate of UC players while minimizing the average games required to get to UC and the length of the path itself.

The source code, PoL frameworks and summaries of results are in [this github repo](https://github.com).
## Introduction

The current Path of Legends system requires 93 steps. If you reach Ultimate Champ and win every game, you can finish in 48 games. Not many players can win 48/48 games and the actual amount of gameplay required to reach UC is normally much higher. In this write up,I will detail how I built and used a computational model of the PoL to find a PoL framework that will best align to these 3 principles:

1. Given $n$ battles played per season, close to 1% of players will reach Ultimate Champion(UC). 
2. Minimize the number of games required to reach Ultimate Champion
3. The Win Pct of the UC players should be maximized

After testing 9 different frameworks, the design that best accomplished this goal was {SOLUTION}


## Method:

### Simplifying Assumptions

First, I built a computational model of the system and made 2 simplifying assumptions:

- Player card and king levels do not matter due to the path level caps. The sole factor in determining who wins a battle is dependent on the two player's legacy bests since it wraps up card level and king level conviently. 
- The players skill/levels stay the same throughout the testing. All 500000 players tested were generated by examining 24000 real players from the api and getting their card level and trophy PBs.

When 2 players match against each other under this assumption, the probably of the higher PB player winning the match, with a given PB difference $d$ is approximated by the equation:

$-0.0000001097213  d^{2}+ 0.00030971 d + 0.48544$

This approximation is from roughly 80000 real battles of players at tournament standard. 

### Data Collection Process

First I needed to know how long to run my model for each path framework. I simulated the current path system with 500k players until 1% of players reached UC.  It took roughly 62 million battles for 1% of the playerbase in UC. I ran this simulation for 5 seasons to ensure that the effect of the win multiplier took affect.  The number of battles required tended to reach a steady value about 4-5 seasons, sometimes earlier. 

With the calibration for the simulation complete, I could experiment with the path frameowrk. Each experiment was run by doing 10 trials (with rng seems 0-9 for reproducability) and calculating the Avg/Stdev 3 things:
- Finishing Step
- Games played to reach UC (UC players only)
- Win Percent (UC PLayers only)

Finally I calculated the average number of UC players. The goal was for this final average to be close to 1%.  

## Results:
There were 9 new path frameworks that were studied in this investigation. When I say no gold steps, I mean no gold steps except for the bottom step. I began by running the simulation on the current PoL model.

### Current Path with 93 steps:

| League | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | UC | 
| --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Step Requirement | 0 | 10 | 21 | 32 | 43 | 54 | 65 | 73 | 82 | 93 |
| Gold Step rule | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 |  N/A |
Drop Leagues: False, Max Multiplier: 9 

| Statistic | Average | St Dev. |
| ------| --- | --- |
| Finishing Step | 58 | 11.4935 |
| UC Games Played | 257.3 | 31.2986 |
| UC Win Percent | 0.593175 | 0.0185538 |
Percent UC:  0.9968

 With the current system, players took on average 257 games to finish the path. Many players finish faster than this, but 257 games is a significant time investment.  There are quire a few players reaching UC with a win percent less than 60%. In the histogram of finishing steps, there is a signifigant drop off of players between steps 65 and 70. This is due to the *final* golden step being at step 65.
