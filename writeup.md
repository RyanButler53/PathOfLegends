# Path of Legends Investigation:

## Abstract: 

In this investigation, I model the Path of Legends (PoL). Using this model, I can gain insights about the PoL, determine the effects of moving/removing golden steps and find a set of parameters that will accomplish 2 goals:

1. Given $n$ battles played per season, close to 1% of players will reach UC. 
2. Minimize the number of games required to reach Ultimate Champion

## Introduction

The current Path of Legends system requires 93 steps. If you reach Ultimate Champ and win every game, you can finish in 48 games. 

## Method:

First, I built a model 

## Results:
Calibration: Given 500k players, to get 0.5% of players to UC it required 49117520 battles with standard deviation of 33226.64283322861 for 11 trials. This Stdev is about 0.06%

1% UC,  avg 51941881. stdev 62963
